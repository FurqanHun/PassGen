# Project PassGen

Project PassGen is a pure C Language program capable of generating a unique password everytime it is executed.

This was my first university project that i worked on as a team, i did have plans to keep updating it
like i did before adding it to repository, if i do i get extra time i might tweak some changes or add features.

## Project PassGen functions

Currently the program can  
1. Generate a passowrd using a number generated through seeding and save it in a .txt file (in hexa form)
2. View the generated password

*you can generate any number of passwords and the program will keep adding it in the list*

To delete a password you'll have to **manually** open the passwords file and remove the unwanted password.

**Additional Program Manual (Help) is added in the program so you can simply check how to use it directly from the program**
